# MANGO
This repository contains code for processing all-sky images generated by the Mid-latitude All-sky-imager Network for Geospace Observations (MANGO), a project funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) (Grant \# AGS-1452357). MANGO has a network of 7 all-sky (wide-angle) cameras across the continental United States to observe the ionospheric airglow occurring at the heights of 250-300km. More information at http://mango.sri.com.

The mangopy project is a python package for accessing and visualizing MANGO data.  The project has several authors as mentioned in each code header. This code can be applied to image processing of other all-sky data (i.e. systems with wide-angle cameras pointed vertically towards the sky).  The code was developed under two NSF funded projects, MANGO (Grant \# AGS-1452357) and InGeO (Grant \# OAC-1835573).

## Installing cartopy
[Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html) is used for visualizing MANGO data and must be installed before mangopy.  Please refer to the [cartopy installation instructions](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html#installing) and make sure cartopy is sucessfully installed on your system before attempting to install mangopy.

## Installing mangopy
1. Clone the MANGO git repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/astib/MANGO.git
```
2. Change directories into the MANGO directory.
```
cd MANGO
```
3. To install mangopy, run the following command.
```
pip install .
```

For basic usage examples, please refer to the mangopy tutorial jupyter notebook, `mangopy_tutorial.ipynb` (https://github.com/astib/MANGO/blob/master/mangopy_tutorial.ipynb).

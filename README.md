# MANGO
This repository contains code for processing all-sky images generated by the Mid-latitude All-sky-imager Network for Geospace Observations (MANGO), a project funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF). MANGO has a network of 7 all-sky (wide-angle) cameras across the continental United States to observe the ionospheric airglow occurring at the heights of 250-300km. More info at http://mango.sri.com
The project has several authors as mentioned in each code header. This code can be applied to image processing of other all-sky data (i.e. systems with wide-angle cameras pointed vertically towards the sky).
